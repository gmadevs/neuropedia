# About the Author

![image](/author.png)

As a neuroradiologist based in Italy, I'm passionate about the intersection of medicine and technology. My work goes beyond diagnostics; I'm deeply committed to sharing knowledge within the medical community and exploring the transformative potential of programming and artificial intelligence in healthcare. When I'm not immersed in the fascinating world of the brain, you'll likely find me indulging my other great passion: being a dedicated movie geek.
