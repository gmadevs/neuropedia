# About the project

## Welcome to NeuroPedia

Are you a medical student, a radiology resident, or a professional with an interest in neuroradiology? Then you've come to the right place! NeuroPedia aims to be your go-to resource for navigating and organizing the vast wealth of knowledge offered by **Radiopaedia.org**, the site we all love and consult daily.

### Your Guide to Neuroradiology

We know how indispensable Radiopaedia is, but also how easy it can be to get lost among its thousands of pages and clinical cases. Our goal is to simplify this process. We've meticulously collected and **organized the most relevant links from Radiopaedia.org**, categorizing them into key areas of neuroradiology:

* **Brain:** From vascular pathologies to tumor lesions, from neurodegenerative diseases to anatomical variants, you'll find a guided path to explore complex brain anatomy and pathology.
* **Spine:** Delve into spinal pathologies, from diagnosing disc herniations to spinal cord lesions, from congenital malformations to inflammatory conditions.
* **Pediatric Neuroradiology:** A delicate and fundamental area where we've selected specific content to address the unique aspects of neurological pathologies in children.
* **Head & Neck:** Explore the anatomical structures and pathologies of this complex region, from diagnosing salivary glands to paranasal sinus lesions, from inflammatory processes to neoplasms.

### From Web to Book: Your Study Companion in PDF

More than just a website! Our project will culminate in the creation of a **textbook in PDF format**. This volume will be an organic and structured collection of all the linked content, professionally formatted using LaTeX. It will be an invaluable tool for offline study, quick reference, and preparing for exams or presentations. Imagine having the best of Radiopaedia at your fingertips, in a single, organized, and ready-to-use document!

### A Project in Continuous Evolution

NeuroPedia is a constantly growing project. Our team is dedicated to continuously researching, selecting, and updating the links, ensuring you always have access to the most pertinent and current content.

We hope NeuroPedia becomes an indispensable ally in your journey of learning and practicing neuroradiology. Explore the site, discover the content, and get ready to have neuroradiology at your fingertips like never before!
